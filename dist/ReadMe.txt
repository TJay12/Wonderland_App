Troubleshooting

View logging.txt in dist folder for detailed information on the apps process status.

If you see the message Make sure score is in range (0 - 100), it means you have entered a value outside of the range 0 - 100 (e.g. 643, -67). The app automatically loops back to the start of entering scores with Maths Score.

If you see the message Please enter a numerical value (0 - 100), it means you have entered a non numerical value (e.g. s,y,d,&). The app automatically loops back to the start of entering scores with Maths Score.

If you see the message Invalid Input, it means you have entered an incorrect option for continuing (e.g. I,x,p,f). The app will continue to prompt for a input until a valid input (y or n) is entered.
